Last night, all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't wanna, but I think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose
Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
